# TourMapper

A website that helps tourists and tour guides connect!

### The backstory

My husband and I were in Quito when we were using an application that showed us points of attraction on a map. The points were attraction weren't very interesting and there were definitely no local gems listed This gave me the idea: what if local tour guides could post their tours on a platform where other tourists could see them? Welcome TourMapper!

In this app, tour guides and locals can post their tours for free and tourists can check them out! If a tourist is feeling grateful/generous, he is more than welcomed to tip the tour guide or hire them for a real-life tour!
